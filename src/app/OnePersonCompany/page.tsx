              <h3>
                Introduction to One Person Company (OPC)
              </h3>
              <p>
                One Person Company (OPC) registration in India was introduced as a concept under the Companies Act of 2013, enabling a single individual to establish a company and enjoy the combined benefits of both a sole proprietorship and a traditional company structure. This concept of 1 person company became available with the implementation of the Companies Act in 2013.
<br/>
The primary objective behind creating one-person companies was to foster entrepreneurship and encourage the formalization of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). According to Section 2(62) of the Companies Act 2013, a company can be formed with just one director and one member, and interestingly, these roles can be held by the same individual. Simply, OPC Company registration allows a single person to set up a limited liability company in India. The following describes the eligibility and procedure to register one person company.

              <p>Before you go ahead and engage in single person company registration process, it's crucial to understand the specific eligibility criteria and limitations that govern its formation.

              <p>In India, OPC company registration is facilitated through the SPICe+ (Simplified Proforma for Incorporating Company Electronically Plus) form, which has replaced the previous application forms for company incorporation.
<br/>
The OPC Registration process consists of two parts:</p>
              <div className="row gy-3 gx-xl-8">
                <div className="col-xl-12">

                    <li className="">
                      <i className="uil uil-check"></i> <strong>Part B:</strong> The subsequent segment, known as Part B, involves furnishing incorporation-related details.

              </div>
              <p>Here are the steps for an single person company registration.</p>
              <h4>Step 1: Obtain a Digital Signature Certificate (DSC)</h4>
              <p>Secure a Digital Signature Certificate (DSC) for the intended director of the OPC. The DSC is utilized for electronically signing crucial documents.</p>
              <h4>Step 2: Obtain Director Identification Number (DIN)</h4>
              <p>Acquire a Director Identification Number (DIN) for the proposed director from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA).</p>
              <h4>Step 3: Name Reservation</h4>
              <p>Apply for name reservation through the MCA portal using Form SPICe+ (Part A). Ensure that the chosen name for your company is distinct and does not resemble any existing company or trademark.</p>
              <h4>Step 4: Prepare MOA and AOA</h4>
              <p>Draft the Memorandum of Association (MOA) and Articles of Association (AOA) clearly to register one person company. These documents define the company's objectives and internal rules.</p>
              <h4>Step 5: File the Forms</h4>
              <p>File the necessary forms with the MCA to register One Person Company. Attach the relevant documents to the SPICe+ form, including MOA, AOA, declarations, proof of the registered office, nominee appointment, and other documents as required by the MCA.</p>
              <h4>Step 6: Certificate of Incorporation</h4>
              <p>Upon approval by the ROC and verification of compliance requirements, the ROC will issue a Certificate of Incorporation, signifying the successful registration of your One Person Company. Notably, the PAN number (Permanent Account Number) and TAN (Tax Deduction and Collection Account Number) are generated automatically during the incorporation process, eliminating the need for separate applications.
